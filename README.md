# ü¶† COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis notebook that explores global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). It analyzes key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and vaccinations across multiple countries over time.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global dataset
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across selected countries
- Visualize data using time-series charts and maps
- Summarize insights in a clear, well-documented report

---

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (for optional choropleth map)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run/View the Project

1. Download the dataset `owid-covid-data.csv` from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and place it in the same folder as the notebook.
2. Open `COVID19_Global_Data_Tracker_Template.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with the Jupyter extension.
3. Run all cells from start to finish to generate analysis and visualizations.

## üìå Insights & Reflections

- India demonstrated the fastest vaccination rollout among the selected countries.
- The USA had significantly higher early case and death counts, but improved after vaccination efforts.
- Kenya showed relatively fewer cases and slower vaccine distribution but managed to stabilize fatality rates.
- Data visualizations helped uncover trends not easily seen through raw numbers.
